## Workshop Summary/Description:

In this interactive workshop, participants will explore the practical applications of generative AI by creating a dynamic micro-service for a fictional restaurant website, complete with a tantalizing menu. Through hands-on demonstrations, attendees will learn to harness the power of AI to generate visually stunning and lifelike food images, which will not only enhance the digital menu but also serve as a valuable resource for chefs in crafting their culinary presentations. By the end of the session, participants will have gained valuable insights into leveraging AI for creative problem-solving and delivering captivating digital experiences.

## Team Experience

- Form teams of people at each table, 4-5 people to a team
- Each Team will come up with their own restaurant and theme
- At least one member of a team should have access to a generative AI service (images and language)
- At least one member of the team should be willing to write some code
- Team roles:
  - Someone who can write code
  - Someone to interact with Language AI
  - Someone to interact with Image AI
  - Others who are idea / creative directors

## Learning Objectives

- Highlight how human creativity drives AI innovation
  - This is one of the reasons we're going to be working in teams
  - Also working in teams utilizes talents, such as technical and creative.
- Understand the practical applications of generative AI in digital experiences
- You are the explorer of your imagination, and your task is to define the creative idea, and have a picture in your mind of what your intended outcome will be. The purpose of the AI is to help you realize your vision by filling in the blanks and performing the "gruntwork".
- When you get stuck, consider ways to ask the generative language model AI the questions that will help get you un-stuck. It is the ultimate tutor!

### Task:

- Use Generative AI to formulate a restaurant experience:

  - What is the theme of the restaurant?
  - What is the name of the restaurant?
    - Use AI to come up with the images for the restaurant:
      - Environment / Dining room / Kitchen / Staff, etc.
  - What is the menu?
    - Establish limits (e.g. 5 appetizers, 5 entrees, 5 desserts)
  - What is a detailed description for each menu item?
    - Create images for a selection of menu items.
  - What other unique ideas can you come up with and generate?

- Create a dynamic micro-service for a fictional restaurant website
- Generate lifelike food images using AI techniques
- Enhance digital menus with visually captivating AI-generated content
- Apply AI-driven solutions for creative problem-solving in various contexts
- Explore the potential of AI to improve user engagement and experiences

## Restaurant Website

- Website should have at least one page:
  - Should contain an image of the restaurant, and the menu
  - Can have multiple pages if the team desires
- The Docker image should contain the website code
- Local browser should be able to interact with the Docker image (site)

## Docker

- Install Docker Desktop
- Create a Dockerfile
- Build the Docker image
- Run the Docker image
